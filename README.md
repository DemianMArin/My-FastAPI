# My-FastAPI

## Encoded Image

Measures avg, max, min time of n numbers of request. This was for testing with different compression levels.

## Chunks

After compressing images wanted faster requests. Tried chunks. I believe 50 ms faster. Don't remember.

## TransferVideo

Sending from `Server` to `Client` video in chunks.
